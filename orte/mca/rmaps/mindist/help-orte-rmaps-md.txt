[multi-apps-and-zero-np]
Open MPI found multiple applications to be launched, and at least one
that failed to specify the number of processes to execute.  When
specifying multiple applications, you must specify how many processes
of each to launch via the -np argument.
#
[orte-rmaps-mindist:no-pci-locality-info]
No PCI locality information could be found on at least one node. 
Please, upgrade BIOS to expose NUMA info.

  Node: %s

Open MPI will map the application by default (BYSLOT).
#
[orte-rmaps-mindist:several-hca-devices]
On at least one node, more than one OpenFabrics device was discovered. 
In this scenario, passing the 'auto' option to the rmaps minimum 
distance mapper is ambiguous and therefore not valid. 
Please select the particular OpenFabrics device that you would like 
to be mapped nearest via -mca rmaps_base_mapping_policy dist:<device>
or --map-by dist:<device>, e.g. --map-by dist:mlx4_0.

  Devices: %d
  Node: %s

Open MPI will map the application by default (BYSLOT).
#
[orte-rmaps-mindist:device-not-found]
An OpenFabrics device was specified that cannot be found on at least one node.

  Device: %s
  Node: %s

Open MPI will map the application by default (BYSLOT).
